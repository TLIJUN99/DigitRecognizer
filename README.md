# DigitRecognizer
A Digit Recognizer built with a pretrained ViT model, FastAPI, StreamLit and HuggingFace Model to predict digits 0-10. The pretrained ViT model is a fine-tuned version of google/vit-base-patch16â€“224-in21k on the mnist dataset.

## Streamlit Web App

- Streamlit is framework for building webapp. The Streamlit webapp will send a HTTP request with the image to FastAPI server. Go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8501/`` to try the Digit Recognizer web app.

## FastAPI server
- FastAPI is a framework for building API in Python. Go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`` to view the API served. FastAPI will run the VIT model for prediction. FastAPI server will then send back the response to the Streamlit webapp

## Docker
- Execute the command to build the docker:

  ``docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build``

- Execute the command to stop the docker:
  
  ``docker compose stop``

- Use the following command to debug docker:

  ``docker logs -f <container name>`` : to view docker logs if container failed to start up

  ``docker ps -a``: to check if the docker containers are running

  ``docker exec -it <container name> bash`` : to enter into the docker containers after docker container are up
